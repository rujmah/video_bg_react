# Virtual Out-and-about React App

Inspired by a number of walkabout/drive-around apps here is my attempt at the basics.

Key features:

- Full screen video
- Muted, autoplay
- Links to the original YouTube video
- No mouseover interaction on video
- Interactive overlays
- Walk/Drive options and instant updates
