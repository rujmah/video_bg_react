# Virtual Out-and-about React App

Inspired by a number of walkabout/drive-around apps here is my attempt at the basics.

## Key features

- [x] Full screen video
- [x] Muted, autoplay
- [x] Links to the original YouTube video
- [x] No mouseover interaction on video
- [ ] Interactive overlays [just a _random_ button at the moment]
- [ ] Walk/Drive options [in development, only walks at present]

## Inspired by

- [Travel Remotely](https://travel-remotely.netlify.app/) - like the ability to select night/day and different transport modes
- [Drive & Listen](https://driveandlisten.herokuapp.com/) - can speed this one up. Really fun.
- [Zen Driving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FEO-XKo4cw) - totally chilled driving
- [@fellowcreative](https://twitter.com/fellowcreative) - the chap who put me on to all these
